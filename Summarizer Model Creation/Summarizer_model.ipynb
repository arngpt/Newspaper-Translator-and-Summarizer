Deborah Arthurs. UPDATED:. 13:47 EST, 4 January 2012. As Burberry\n","today unveils its new spring/summer campaign in store windows and\n","across social media networking sites, millions of ardent fans will be\n","watching. Just last month, it was announced that the British company\n","had become the world's most successful  luxury fashion brand on\n","Facebook and Twitter, with a record 10million fans on Facebook, and\n","almost 700,000 following the brand's regular UK feed on Twitter.\n","Meanwhile, they have thousands more global Twitter fans following\n","their international feeds and post exclusive content on their own\n","YouTube channel. Behind the scenes: Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne\n","on set of the latest Burberry campaign. Burberry's social media\n","success has grown exponentially - and it is still growing fast. The\n","secret, say consumer experts, is the fact that Burberry share so much\n","unique content exclusively with their followers on social networking\n","platforms, and post new and different content to each one. What is\n","posted on Facebook will be different from that on Twitter, and\n","dialogues are constantly being carried out across both. Just this\n","morning, Burberry placed. three new videos from their latest campaign,\n","starring My Week With. Marilyn star Eddie Redmayne and Cara\n","Delevingne, onto their YouTube channel. And at the news that the brand\n","had. reached 10million Facebook fans, Burberry Chief Creative Officer\n","Christopher. Bailey uploaded a personal thank you via a video message\n","to the site. Days later, a further 163,000 had joined. At ease: The\n","two chat between shots. All this direct contact gives fans that bit\n","more involvement with the brand - and keeps them connected.\n","'Christopher is really involved,' Burberry told MailOnline. 'He has\n","answered fans' questions personally on. Facebook, and he's very active\n","on Twitter.' 'It gives people something new. It's a direct and\n","personal route for them.' Their groundbreaking, inclusive. approach\n","goes against the practiced elitism of luxury brands, and ultimately\n","brings. fans closer rather than keeping them at a distance. While\n","other fashion houses operate. strict closed-door policies that isolate\n","all but the inner circle - Tom. Ford famously showed his last\n","collection to a tiny selection of invited. contacts, with no\n","photographers and only a handful of select Press allowed - Burberry\n","have. embraced this public approach. Indeed, Burberry was the world's\n","first. fashion house to 'Tweettalk', posting images from its\n","autumn/winter fashion show on to. Twitter -. before the models had\n","even stepped out onto the catwalk. The innovative move meant fans.\n","were able to see the collection before the celebrity front row and\n","the. fashion Press had even caught a glimpse. For his part, current\n","star of the. campaign Eddie Redmayne reports that Christopher Bailey\n","is, as one would. expect from his democratic approach to business, a\n","'gem of a man' 'I am a huge fan of Christopher Bailey,' he says. 'He\n","is a brilliant designer and a brilliant man. 'The fashion world can be\n","a tad intimidating but Christopher remains a kind, grounded gem of a\n","man. And judging by the latest figures, there are at least 10 million\n","people out there who agree. Intense: Cara, 18, has been the face of\n","Burberry since January last year, when she appeared in the brand's\n","S/S11 campaign. Check it out: The spring/summer Burberry campaign\n","starring My Week With Marilyn's Eddie Redmayne and Brit socialite and\n","model Cara Delevingne. The pair model the Spring Summer 2012\n","collection for the Burbery Prorsum collection. Social media success\n","story: Burberry has over 10m Facebook fans - and counting. About the\n","videos, Bailey says: 'We wanted to capture a moment in the lives of\n","two exciting and inspiring British actors who have been part of the\n","Burberry family for several years. 'The images reflect the mood of the\n","collection through Eddie's and Cara's energy, playfulness and\n","effortless elegance and I have such huge admiration for them both.'\n","Follow Burberry at www.facebook.com/burberry,.\n","www.twitter.com/burberry, www.youtube.com/burberry, www.burberry.com\n","and www.artofthetrench.com.<EOS><pad>Brandhas 10,163,728 fans on\n","Facebook while 694,495 follow UK Twitter feed.
