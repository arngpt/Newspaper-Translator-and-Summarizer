Example 2 - 
A city trader who conned millions of pounds from wealthy investors was yesterday ordered to pay back £1.

Nicholas Levene, 48, was jailed for 13 years last November after he admitted orchestrating a lucrative Ponzi scheme which raked in £316million.

He used the money to finance his own lavish lifestyle with private jets, super yachts and round-the-world trips.

Must pay £1: Jailed city trader Nicholas Levene (pictured arriving at court in November last year), who conned wealthy investors out of £316million, was ordered to pay the nominal sum because he is bankrupt

Now, because he is bankrupt, he has been given seven days to pay back a nominal sum of £1.

The Serious Fraud Office found that Levene had conned £32,352,027 from some of Britain’s most successful businessmen.

But with interest and lost profits, his clients are believed to be £101,685,406 out of pocket.
